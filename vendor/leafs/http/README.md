Leaf's HTTP abstraction is a developer friendly way to interact with HTTP requests and responses. If you are using it within a Leaf app, there's no need to install anything as it comes pre-installed with Leaf. If you are using it outside of Leaf, you can install it via composer.

## Installation

You can easily install Leaf using the [Leaf CLI](https://cli.leafphp.dev)

```sh
leaf install http
```

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require leafs/http
```

## Basic Usage

You can find the full documentation on how to use Leaf Http [here](https://leafphp.dev/docs/http/request).
